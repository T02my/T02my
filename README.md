Hello and welcome to my Github's page.

My name is Wladislaw Pankratow. I'm trying to become front-end developer and currently looking for any related-job.

I possess knowledge of HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, jQuery, Bootstrap 3/4, React. But without recent commercial experience =)

I'm able to write small scripts in PHP or Python.

Can intercommunicate into Russian language (it's my mother's tongue), English (not perfect, but still good enough to read documentation on it) and Czech language (a bit).


You can contant me via T02myPL@gmail.com.
